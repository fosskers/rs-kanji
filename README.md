# Kanji

A library for the handling and analysis of Japanese text, particularly Kanji. It
can be used to find the density of Kanji in given texts according to their
*Level* classification, as defined by the Japan Kanji Aptitude Testing
Foundation (日本漢字能力検定協会).

The Kanji data presented here matches the Foundation's official 2020 February
charts. Note that [some Kanji had their levels changed][changed] (pdf) as of
2020.

See the documentation for further explanation and usage examples.

For the Haskell version of this library, [see here][haskell].
